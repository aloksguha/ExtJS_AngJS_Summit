    <p>The scalability, maintainability and flexibility of an application is
        mostly determined by the quality of the application’s architecture.
        Unfortunately, it’s often treated as an afterthought. Proofs of concept
        and prototypes turn into massive applications, and example code is
        copied and pasted into the foundations of many applications. You may be
        tempted to do this because of the quick progress that you see at the
        start of a project.</p>

    <p>However, the time saved will be relatively low compared to the time spent
        on having to maintain, scale and often refactor your application later
        in the project. One way to better prepare for writing a solid
        architecture is to follow certain conventions and define application
        views, models, stores and controllers before actually implementing them.
        In this article, we’ll take a look at a popular application and discuss
        how we might architect the user interface to create a solid
        foundation.</p>

    <p>Application architecture is as much about providing structure and
        consistency as it is about actual classes and framework code. Building a
        good architecture unlocks a number of important benefits:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Every application works the same way so you only have to learn it
            once
        </li>
        <li>It’s easy to share code between apps because they all work the same
            way
        </li>
        <li>You can use Ext JS build tools to create optimized versions of your
            applications for production use
        </li>
    </ul>


    <p>In Ext JS 4, we have defined conventions that you should consider
        following when building your applications — most notably a unified
        directory structure. This simple structure places all classes into the
        app folder, which in turn contains sub-folders to namespace your models,
        views, controllers and stores.</p>

    <p>While Ext JS 4 offers best practices on how to structure your
        application, there’s room to modify our suggested conventions for naming
        your files and classes. For example, you might decide that in your
        project you want to add a suffix to your controllers with “Controller,”
        e.g. “Users” becomes “UsersController.” In this case, remember to always
        add a suffix to both the controller file and class. The important thing
        is that you define these conventions before you start writing your
        application and consistently follow them. Finally, while you can call
        your classes whatever you want, we strongly suggest following our
        convention for the names and structure of folders (controller, model,
        store, view). This will ensure that you get an optimized build using our
        SDK Tools beta.</p>

    <h3>Views</h3>

    <p>Splitting up the application’s UI into views is a good place to start.
        Often, you are provided with wireframes and UI mockups created by
        designers. Imagine we are asked to rebuild the (very attractive) Pandora
        application using Ext JS, and are given the following mockup by our UI
        Designer.</p>

    <p></p>

    <p><img src="guides/mvc_pt1/base_layout.png" alt="Base Layout"></p>

    <p></p>

    <p>What we want to achieve is a balance between the views being too granular
        and too generic. Let’s start by seeing what happens if we divide our UI
        into too many views.</p>

    <p></p>

    <p><img src="guides/mvc_pt1/too-granular.png" alt="Too Granular"></p>

    <p></p>

    <p>Splitting up the UI into too many small views will make it difficult to
        manage, reference and control the views in our controllers. Also, since
        every view will be in its own file, creating too many views might make
        it hard to locate the view file where a piece of the UI or view logic is
        defined.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, we don’t want our views to be too generic because it
        will impact our flexibility to change things.</p>

    <p></p>

    <p><img src="guides/mvc_pt1/too-general.png" alt="Too General"></p>

    <p></p>

    <p>In this scenario, each one of our views has been overly simplified. When
        several parts of a view require custom view-logic, the view class will
        end up having too many responsibilities, resulting in the view class
        becoming harder to maintain. In addition, when the designers change
        their mind about the arrangement of the UI, we will end up having to
        refactor our view definition and view logic; which can get tedious.</p>

    <p>The right balance is achieved when we can easily rearrange the views on
        the page without having to refactor them every time. For example, we
        want to make the Ad a separate view, so we can easily move it around or
        even remove it later.</p>

    <p></p>

    <p><img src="guides/mvc_pt1/balanced.png" alt="Balanced"></p>

    <p></p>

    <p>In this version, we’ve separated our UI by the roles of each view. Once
        you have a general idea of the views that will make up your UI, you can
        still tweak the granularity when you’re actually implementing them.
        Sometimes you may find that two views should really become one, or a
        view is too generic and should be split into multiple views, but it
        helps to start out with a good base. I think we’ve done that here.</p>

    <h3>Models</h3>

    <p>Now that we have the basic structure of our views in place, it’s time to
        look at the models. By looking at the types of dynamic data in our UI,
        we can get an idea of the different models needed for our
        application.</p>

    <p></p>

    <p><img src="guides/mvc_pt1/models.png" alt="Models"></p>

    <p></p>

    <p>We’ve decided to use only two models — Song and Station. We could have
        defined two more models called Artist and Album. However, just as with
        views, we don’t want to be too granular when defining our models. In
        this case, we don’t have to separate artist and album information
        because the app doesn’t allow the user to select a specific song by a
        given artist. Instead, the data is organized by station, the song is the
        center point, and the artist and album are properties of the song. That
        means we’re able to combine the song, artist and album data into one
        model. This greatly simplifies the data side of our app. It also
        simplifies the API that we have to implement on the server-side because
        we don’t have to load individual artists or albums. To summarize, for
        this example, we’ll only have two models — Song and Station.</p>

    <h3>Stores</h3>

    <p>Now that we’ve thought about the models our application will use, lets do
        the same for stores.</p>

    <p></p>

    <p><img src="guides/mvc_pt1/stores.png" alt="Stores"></p>

    <p></p>

    <p>Figuring out the different stores you need is often relatively easy. A
        good strategy is to determine all the data bound components on the page.
        In this case, we have a list with all of the user’s favorite stations, a
        scroller with the recently played songs, and a search field that will
        display search results. Each of these views will need to be bound to
        stores.</p>

    <h3>Controllers</h3>

    <p>There are several ways you can distribute the application’s
        responsibilities across your application’s controllers. Let’s start by
        thinking about the different controllers we need in this example.</p>

    <p></p>

    <p><img src="guides/mvc_pt1/controllers.png" alt="Controllers"></p>

    <p></p>

    <p>Here we have two basic controllers — a SongController and a
        StationController. Ext JS 4 allows you to have one controller that can
        control several views at the same time. Our StationController will
        handle the logic for both creating new stations as well as loading the
        user’s favorite stations into the StationsList view. The SongController
        will take care of managing the SongInfo view and RecentSong store as
        well as the user’s actions of liking, disliking, pausing and skipping
        songs. Controllers can interact with each other by firing and listening
        for application events. While we could have created additional
        Controllers, one for managing playback and another for searching
        stations, I think we’ve found a good separation of responsibilities.</p>

    <p>I hope that sharing our thoughts on the importance of planning your
        application architecture prior to writing code was helpful. We find that
        talking through the details of the application helps you to build a much
        more flexible and maintainable architecture.</p>
