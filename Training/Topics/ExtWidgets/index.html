                A JS widget is a stand-alone application that can be embedded
                into
                third party sites by any user on a page where they have rights
                of authorship, e.g. a webpage, blog, or profile on a social
                media site. Widgets allow users to turn personal content into
                dynamic web apps that can be shared on websites where the code
                can be installed. For example, a "Weather Report Widget" could
                report today's weather by accessing data from the Weather
                Channel, it could even be sponsored by the Weather Channel. For
                website visitors to view, it must be embedded in a webpage, such
                as a Blogger blog sidebar. Even the portion of a blog where the
                ads are displayed is a widget.
